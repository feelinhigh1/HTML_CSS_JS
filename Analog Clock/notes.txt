12 hr -> 360 
1 hr -> 30 
h hr -> 30h

When the minute hand is moving, automatically the hour hand is also moving with it.
60 min -> 30
1 min -> 1/2
m min -> m/2

When the second hand is moving, automatically the hour hand is also moving with it.
60 sec -> 1/2
1 sec -> 1/120
s sec -> s/120


So, formula for hour hand 
-> 30h + m/2 + s/120

60 min -> 360
1 min -> 6
m min -> 6m

When the second hand is moving, automatically the hour hand is also moving with it.
60 sec -> 6
1 sec -> 1/10
s sec -> s/10


So, formula for minute hand 
-> 6m + s/10

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



60 sec -> 360
1 sec -> 6
s sec -> 6s

So, formula for second hand
-> 6s
