The animation part of your CSS code handles the rotation of the car wheels, giving the illusion that the car is moving.

Breakdown of the Animation:


1. Keyframes Definition:

@keyframes wheelRotation {
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

@keyframes wheelRotation: This defines the animation sequence named wheelRotation.
100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }: This means that by the end of the animation (at 100% of its duration), the element will have rotated a full 360 degrees.

Since there's no 0% defined, it starts from the default state (0 degrees rotation) and rotates to 360 degrees over the animation duration.



2. Applying the Animation to the Wheels:


.wheel1 img {
  width: 77px;
  position: relative;
  top: 44px;
  left: 47px;
  animation: wheelRotation linear 0.6s infinite;
}

.wheel2 img {
  width: 77px;
  position: relative;
  top: -36px;
  left: 248px;
  animation: wheelRotation linear 0.6s infinite;
}


animation: wheelRotation linear 0.6s infinite;

wheelRotation: Refers to the keyframes animation we defined earlier.

linear: Specifies the timing function. A linear timing function means the rotation happens at a constant speed without acceleration or deceleration.

0.6s: This is the duration of one complete rotation (360 degrees). Each wheel completes one rotation every 0.6 seconds.

infinite: This makes the animation loop endlessly, so the wheels keep spinning as long as the page is active.



How It Works Together:

The keyframes define how the wheels rotate (from 0° to 360°).

The .wheel1 img and .wheel2 img classes apply this animation to the wheel images.

Since the animation is infinite, the wheels keep rotating, simulating a moving car.

If you want to adjust the speed of the wheels, you can change the 0.6s value to a faster (smaller) or slower (larger) duration.















@keyframes carMove {
  100% {
    transform: translateX(-500vw);
  }
}

@keyframes carMove: This defines a new animation sequence called carMove.

100% { transform: translateX(-500vw); }:

At the end of the animation (100%), the element will be moved 500 viewport widths (vw) to the left.

translateX(-500vw) shifts the element horizontally by 500 times the width of the viewport. Since it's negative, the movement goes leftward.



Apllying the animation to the track

Animation: carMove linear 13s infinite;


carMove: Refers to the keyframes you defined for moving the car.

linear: The car will move at a constant speed from start to finish, with no acceleration or deceleration.

13s: The animation will take 13 seconds to complete one full movement from its starting position to translateX(-500vw).

infinite: The animation will repeat endlessly, creating a loop where the car keeps moving across the screen over and over.
